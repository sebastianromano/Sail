# Sailing Tracker

## Description
The Sailing Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their sailing activities, including speed, distance, and location on a map. It also includes a compass and charts to visualize the user's performance. This app was created because many of the existing sailing tracking apps on the App Store are filled with ads and anti-user behavior, including excessive tracking and data collection.

## Features
- Real-time location tracking using the device's GPS
- Calculation and display of speed and distance traveled
- Interactive map showing the user's route
- Compass for heading information
- Line charts for speed and distance over time
- Ability to keep the screen on during tracking

## Installing on iPhone and Android
Since the Sailing Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA), you can easily add it to your device's home screen for quick access.

3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen".

The Sailing Tracker icon will now be added to your iPhone's home screen, and you can launch the app just like any other installed app.
